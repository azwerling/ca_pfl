# California Paid Family Leave Trends, 2005 - 2023

This analysis reviews CA's Paid Family Leave Program (PFL) from data provided by the [EDD's Open Data Portal]([url](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/paid-family-leave-pfl-monthly-data)). Additional sources include the [Births Report]([url](https://dof.ca.gov/serp/?q=births)) from the CA Department of Finance and the [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis]([url](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSCAA646N)).

Highlights include:
- An increase of bonding claims though the CA birth rate is declining.
- More than half of Californians receive the maximum benefit amount.
- Californians who adopt the program generally take advantage of the maximum number of weeks allotted.
- An area of opportunity to increase awareness about caregiver leave.
